## Abstract

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has made it easier than ever to create chatbots capable of generating human-like responses to user inputs. Moreover, improvements in text-to-speech and speech-to-text make it possible to converse with these systems, not just in text but also through speech. 
These improvements have led to an increase in chatbot applications across various contexts, such as customer service and healthcare. 
This study looked at the tendency to anthropomorphize chatbots in a mental health assessment context. 
Participants were randomized to converse with the chatbot (Alba), either through text or speech alone. Neurotypical and people with ADHD were recruited. The results show that neurotypical users anthropomorphized the system equally in both conditions. However, contrary to the hypothesis, users with ADHD anthropomorphized Alba _less_ in the speech condition. We believe that these results are due to longer response times from Alba in the voice than the text condition.
